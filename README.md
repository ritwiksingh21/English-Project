# English-Project

### Description:
This project is all about creating a curated collection of Youtube videos (with proper credits to owner) teaching english language. We have taken a website approach for this instead of basic Youtube playlist because a website enables us to add many more features to enhance the process of learning.

### Technologies used:
- HTML
- CSS
- Youtube API
### Files in this repo:
- Main Page--> index.html
- Common stylesheet for all pages --> index.css
- Other pages--> tutorial.html, demo.html, contact.html;
- Images used--> indexback.jpg(index.html background), social.png(side float icon).
